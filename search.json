    "text": "The New Orleans Saints are one of the worst teams in the NFL. Many blame it on the quarterback, but is that really the true reason why they are always losing?\nSpencer Rattler has a an abysmal record of 1-12 as a starter in the NFL. Does this record truly represent him as a quarterback?\nLet’s take a look at where Rattler’s QBR sits alongside the other starting quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnflqbstats &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/spmc_350_fall_2025_gubbels/nfl_passing_stat_leaders.csv\")\n\nstartingqbs &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt;\n  filter(Pos  == \"QB\")\n\nsaints &lt;- startingqbs |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Spencer Rattler\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=startingqbs, aes(x=reorder(Player, QBR), weight=QBR)) +\n  geom_bar(data=saints, aes(x=reorder(Player, QBR), weight=QBR), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo we see that Rattler definitely wasn’t great, but his QBR isn’t too far from quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Bo Nix. Both these quarterbacks currently have winning records with Bo Nix and the Broncos being a top team in the AFC.\nSince maybe QBR isn’t too accurate of a stat, lets look at where Rattler sits at in the passing yards poll.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnflqbstats &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/spmc_350_fall_2025_gubbels/new_passing_yds_leaders.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nnflqbstatsfiltered &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt; \n  filter(YDS &gt; 1000) |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\")\n\nsr &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Spencer Rattler\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=nflqbstatsfiltered, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=YDS), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=sr, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=YDS), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=sr, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=YDS, label=Player))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRattler is currently sitting at 24 out of 32 quarterbacks int he passing yards column.\nAgain not good by any means, but he also isn’t the worst of them all.\nNow we finally should look at Rattler’s touchdown to interception ratio compared tot he other starting quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nnflqbstats &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/spmc_350_fall_2025_gubbels/new_passing_yds_leaders.csv\")\n\ntdint &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\") |&gt;\n  filter(GS &gt; 5)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=tdint, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, TD), x=TD, xend=Int),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")"
