    "section": "",
    "text": "The New Orleans Saints are one of the worst teams in the NFL. Many blame it on the quarterback, but is that really the true reason why they are always losing?\nSpencer Rattler has a an abysmal record of 1-12 as a starter in the NFL. Does this record truly represent him as a quarterback?\nLet’s take a look at where Rattler’s QBR sits alongside the other starting quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnflqbstats &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/spmc_350_fall_2025_gubbels/nfl_passing_stat_leaders.csv\")\n\nstartingqbs &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt;\n  filter(Pos  == \"QB\")\n\nsaints &lt;- startingqbs |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Spencer Rattler\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=startingqbs, aes(x=reorder(Player, QBR), weight=QBR)) +\n  geom_bar(data=saints, aes(x=reorder(Player, QBR), weight=QBR), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"QBR\", \n    title=\"Rattler struggles, but isn't as bad as we're told\", \n    subtitle=\"Spencer Rattler isn't an elite quarterback, but he also isn't the worst.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Josh Gubbels\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that Rattler definitely wasn’t great with a QBR of 49.1, but his QBR isn’t too far from quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Bo Nix. Both these quarterbacks currently have winning records with Bo Nix and the Broncos being a top team in the AFC.\nSince maybe QBR isn’t too accurate of a stat, lets look at where Rattler sits at in the passing yard rankings.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnflqbstats &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/spmc_350_fall_2025_gubbels/new_passing_yds_leaders.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nnflqbstatsfiltered &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt; \n  filter(YDS &gt; 1000) |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\")\n\nsr &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Spencer Rattler\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=nflqbstatsfiltered, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=YDS), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=sr, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=YDS), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=sr, \n    aes(x=Pos, y=YDS, label=Player))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Passing Yards\", \n    title=\"Rattler still doesn't impress in passing yards\", \n    subtitle=\"Rattler is a little higher in the ranks here, but he is still in the lower third of quarterbacks.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Josh Gubbels\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRattler is currently sitting at 24 out of 32 quarterbacks in the passing yards column. He is sitting right above quarterbacks such as Lamar Jackson, Jaxson Dart, and Justin Fields.\nAgain not good by any means, but he also isn’t the worst of them all.\nNow we finally will look at Rattler’s touchdown to interception ratio compared to the other starting quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nnflqbstats &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/spmc_350_fall_2025_gubbels/new_passing_yds_leaders.csv\")\n\ntdint &lt;- nflqbstats |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\") |&gt;\n  filter(GS &gt; 5)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=tdint, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, TD), x=TD, xend=Int),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"TD/INT\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Rattler is not a standout quarterback\", \n    subtitle=\"Spencer Rattler doesn't have a lot of touchdowns, but also doesn't have very many interceptions.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Josh Gubbels\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see Spencer Rattler isn’t throwing a lot of touchdowns or interceptions. On the bright side of things he has a positive touchdowns to interceptions ratio unlike Geno Smith and Cam Ward.\nMany can make the excuses of bad play calling, or the fact that the Saints have the 28th ranked rushing offense in the NFL. With such a bad rushing game it can be hard to move the ball in the air.\nThe Saints defense can also use some improvement in being ranked 21st in rushing defense and 23rd in points allowed per game. When you aren’t able to stop another teams offense it can be hard for your own offense to keep up.\nAt the end of the day Spencer Rattler isn’t a franchise quarterback, but he could be a really good backup with the right team and coaching staff around him."
